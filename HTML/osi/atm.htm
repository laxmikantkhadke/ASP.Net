<h3>Overview</h3>
ATM stands for <em>asynchronous transfer mode</em>, whereby information
packets are transferred asynchronously. This mode is another fast-packet
switchig mode. ATM has the same basic characteristics of packet switching,
 but also the delay characteristics of circuit-switching technology. This combination is
obtained by reducing the network functionality to minimum. The word <em>asynchronous </em> is
used because ATM allows asynchronous operation between the sender clock and receiver
clock. The difference between the both clocks can be easily solved by inserting and
removing empty or unassigned cells (packets thst do not contain any information).
The advantages ATM offers are:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility - ATM can be easily evolved for future services.</li>
<li>Efficiency in the use of its available resources.</li>
<li>It is one simple unversal network.</li>
<li>Reduction of operation, administrative, and maintenance costs.</li>
<li>Reduction of transport costs (by statistical multiplexing).</li>
<li>Provision of dynamic bandwidth allocation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ATM principle</h3>
ATM does not care what the information is or its form. It simply cuts the information into equal-sized packets or cells and attaches a header so the packet can be routed to its destination. The headers in ATM have very little functionality, so they can be processoed by the network without delay. <br/><br/>

As shown in fig a traffic of different speeds, namely 64 kbps,2 Mbps and 34 Mbps, is chopped into a equal-sized packets or cells by "chopper" or "cell slicer." The different cells are put into a huge transmission pipe that mixes all the cells from different sources in such a way that the transmission pipe is optimized. The optimization is done via a technique called <em>statistical multiplexing.</em>
<br/>
In an ATM network, several sources are combined or multiplexed on a single link. In a conventional time division multiplexing (TDM) network, the effective bandwidth is simply a sum of individual sources' bandwidth. If two sources of bandwidth are <em>x</em> bps and <em>y</em> bps, their effective bandwidth is (x+y) bps. The effective bandwidth in an ATM network, however, is z bps, where z < (x+y) because all the infoemation in bits is packeted into ATM cells. The ATM switch then multiplexes the cell that carry valid information, thus discarding cells with with zero or invalid information. Thus , effective bandwidth is reduced. This bandwitdh can also carry other user's traffic.<br/>
ATM switch does not differentiate between the type of traffic carried within cell. All it knows is that it has an input port, where cells come in, and a destination port, where cells go.
<h3>ATM cell format</h3>
At the core of the ATM architecture is a fixed length "cell." An ATM cell is a short, fixed length block of data that contains a short header with addressing information, followed by the upper layer traffic, or "payload." The cell structure, shown in Figure 1, is 53 octets long, with a 5 octet header, followed by 48 bytes of payload. While the short packet may seem to be somewhat inefficient in its ratio of overhead to actual data, it does have some distinct advantages over the alternatives. By fixing the length of each cell, the timing characteristics of the links and the corresponding network are regular and relatively easy to predict; predicting the dynamics of variable length packet switched networks isn't always easy. By using short cells, hardware based switching can be accomplished. Finally, the use of short cells provides an ability to transfer isochronous information with a short delay.

 <br/><br/>The fields in the ATM Cells are: <br/>
<ul>
<li>GFC - (Generic Flow Control) used only in the UNI format. No general purpose services have been assigned to this field, and it is significant for only the local site. This flow control information is not carried from end-to-end. Two modes have been used for GFC based flow control, "uncontrolled access" and "controlled access." in uncontrolled access, this field is set to all zeroes. In controlled access mode, this field is set when congestion has occurred. The receiving equipment will report instances in which the GFC has been set a significant number of times to Layer Management.</li>
<li>VPI/VCI - (Virtual Path Identifier/Virtual Channel Identifier). The distribution of bits between these two fields can be negotiated between the user and network equipment. Referring back to Figure 4, these identifiers are used to tag only the portion of the path/circuit connection over a single link. It is the combination of all of the individual paths and circuits that comprise the connection.</li>
<li>PT - (Payload Type) Indicates whether or not the cell contains use information or Layer Management Information. It also carries implicit congestion information.</li>
<li>CLP - (Cell Loss Priority). Indicates the cell's priority in the ATM selective loss algorithm. Set by the initiating equipment, when this set to 0, the cell is given preference over cells with CLP set to 1.</li>
<li>HEC - (Header Error Control). Provides a capability to correct all single bit errors in the cell header as well as the detection of the majority of multiple-bit errors. The use of this field is up to interpretation of the equipment designers. If most errors are likely to be single bit errors, it can be used for error correction. Using the field for error correction does carry some level of risk of introducing unwanted errant traffic on the network should a mistake be made in the correction process.</li>
</ul>
