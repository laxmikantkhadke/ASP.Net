<h3>ICMPv6 Overview</h3>
Like IPv4, the specification for the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) header and extension
headers does not provide facilities for reporting errors. Instead, IPv6 uses an updated version
of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) named ICMP version 6 (ICMPv6). ICMPv6
has the common IPv4 ICMP functions of reporting delivery and forwarding errors and providing
a simple echo service for troubleshooting. ICMPv6 is defined in RFC 4443 and is required
for an IPv6 implementation.<br/>
The ICMPv6 protocol also provides a packet structure framework for the following:<br/>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:bold;">Neighbor Discovery
<p style="font-family:times new roman, times,serif;font-weight:normal;">
 Neighbor Discovery (ND) is a series of five ICMPv6 messages that
manage node-to-node communication on a link. ND replaces Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP), ICMPv4 Router Discovery, and the ICMPv4 Redirect message.</p>
</li> 
<li style="font-weight:bold;">Multicast Listener Discovery
<p style="font-family:times new roman, times,serif;font-weight:normal;">
 Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) is a series of three
ICMPv6 messages that are equivalent to the Internet Group Management Protocol
(IGMP) for IPv4 for managing subnet multicast membership. </p>
</li>
</ul>
ICMPv6 is also used by other protocols, such as Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND). SEND is
not supported by IPv6 for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  RFC 4884 describes changes to ICMPv6 to support multipart messages. These
changes are not supported by IPv6 for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 and are not
described in this chapter.<br/>

<h3>Types of ICMPv6 Messages</h3>
There are two types of ICMPv6 messages:<br/>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:bold;">Error messages
<p style="font-family:times new roman, times,serif;font-weight:normal;">
 Error messages report errors in the forwarding or delivery of IPv6
packets by either the destination node or an intermediate router. The high-order bit of
the 8-bit Type field for all ICMPv6 error messages is set to 0. Therefore, valid values for
the Type field for ICMPv6 error messages are in the range of 0 through 127. ICMPv6
error messages include Destination Unreachable, Packet Too Big, Time Exceeded, and
Parameter Problem.</p></li>
<li style="font-weight:bold;">Informational messages
<p style="font-family:times new roman, times,serif;font-weight:normal;">
 Informational messages provide diagnostic functions and
additional host functionality, such as MLD and ND. The high-order bit of the 8-bit Type
field for all ICMPv6 informational messages is set to 1. Therefore, valid values for the
Type field for ICMPv6 information messages are in the range of 128 through 255.
ICMPv6 informational messages described in RFC 4443 include Echo Request and Echo
Reply. There are additional ICMPv6 informational messages defined for Mobile IPv6.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>ICMPv6 Error Messages</h4>
ICMPv6 error messages report forwarding or delivery errors by either a router or the destination
host, and they consist of the following messages:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Destination Unreachable (ICMPv6 Type 1)<br/>
A router or a destination host sends an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message when the
packet cannot be forwarded to the destination node or upper-layer protocol.
</li>
<li>Packet Too Big (ICMPv6 Type 2)<br/>
A router sends an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big message when the packet cannot be forwarded
because the link MTU on the forwarding interface of the router is smaller than the size of the
IPv6 packet.
</li>
<li>Time Exceeded (ICMPv6 Type 3)<br/>
A router typically sends an ICMPv6 Time Exceeded message when the Hop Limit field in the
IPv6 header becomes zero after decrementing its value during the forwarding process.
</li>
<li>Parameter Problem (ICMPv6 Type 4)<br/>
A router or the destination sends an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem message when there is an
error in the IPv6 header or an extension header that prevents IPv6 from performing additional
processing.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>ICMPv6 Informational Messages</h3>
The ICMPv6 informational messages defined in RFC 4443 provide a simple diagnostic
capability to aid in troubleshooting and consist of the following messages:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Echo Request (ICMPv6 Type 128)<br/>
An IPv6 node sends an ICMPv6 Echo Request message to a destination to solicit an immediate
Echo Reply message. The Echo Request/Echo Reply message facility provides a simple
diagnostic function to aid in the troubleshooting of a variety of reachability and routing
problems.
</li>
<li>Echo Reply (ICMPv6 Type 129)<br/>
An IPv6 node sends an ICMPv6 Echo Reply message in response to the receipt of an ICMPv6
Echo Request message.
</li>
</ul>
