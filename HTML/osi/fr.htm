<h3>Overview</h3>
Frame relay is an emerging data communication concept sanctioned by
ITU-T and ANSI. It is fast packet technology developed to improve upon 
the X.25 packet technology. The development of fast packet was possible
after emergence of various technologies. Frame relay gets its name from 
the frame designation of the OSI data link layer. It was essentilly 
developed through two technologies.
<ul>
<li>Widespread development of optical fiber-based transmission.</li>
<li>Intelligent customer premises equipment (CPE).</li>
</ul>
The frame relay protocol supports data transmission over connection-oriented paths.
The interface from the user to the frame relay network is called frame relay interface
(FRI). FRI currently supports the following access speeds:
<ul>
<li>56kbps</li>
<li>n X 64 kbps</li>
<li>1.544 Mbps (T1)</li>
<li>2.048 Mbps (E1) </li>
</ul>
In addition, there are some intermediate speeds, but the highest is T1 or E1.
<br/>
FRI is an enhanced version of X.25 without error correction at the intermediate nodes. 
Error corrections in a frame relay network occure in the intelligent CPE at either end 
of the connection, thus making frame relay much faster than X.25. Frame relay relies on
 the equipment to perform the functions done by network. Advances in transmission 
technology and, of course, the terminal equipment has allowed this change to occure.
These advances have made frame relay a standard in data communications from 56kbps to 
T1- or E1-based applications and is slowly replacing the X.25 based packet switched network. 
For speed below 56kbps, the packet-switched network is still ideal.

<h3>Frame Relay Standards</h3>
The ITU-T has divided the functions and features of frame relay into three major standards.

<h3>Frame Relay Field Format</h3>
Folowing fig shows the basic format of frame relay field.<br/><br/>
<img src="fr.gif" height="121" width="386">
<br/>
The frame relay format has five different fields, eachof varying lengths.
These fields are
<ul>
<li>Flag field</li>
<li>Frame relay header </li>
<li>Information Field</li>
<li>Frame check sequence field</li>
<li>Trailing Flag field</li>
</ul>
Each of these fields isresponsible for specific function. 

<h4>DLCI</h4>
10-bit DLCI field represents the address of the frame and corresponds to a PVC.

<h4>C/R</h4>
Designates whether the frame is a command or response.

<h4>EA</h4>
Extended Address field signifies up to two additional bytes in the Frame Relay header, thus greatly expanding the number of possible addresses.

<h4>FECN</h4>
Forward Explicit Congestion Notification.

<h4>BECN</h4>
Backward Explicit Congestion Notification.

<h4>DE</h4>
Discard Eligibility.
