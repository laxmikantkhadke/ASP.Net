<hr color="black">

Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) is the IPv6 equivalent of Internet Group Management
Protocol version 2 (IGMPv2) defined in RFC 2236 for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4).
MLD is a set of messages exchanged by routers and hosts, allowing routers to discover the set
of multicast addresses for which there is at least one listening host for each attached subnet.
Like IGMPv2, MLD does not allow routers to discover the list of individual multicast listeners
for each multicast address. MLD is described in RFC 2710.<br/>
MLD version 2 (MLDv2) is the IPv6 equivalent of IGMP version 3 (IGMPv3) defined in RFC
3376 for IPv4. MLDv2 performs the same functions as MLD, but it allows IPv6 hosts to
register interest in source-specific multicast traffic with their local multicast routers. An
MLDv2-capable host can register interest in receiving IPv6 multicast traffic from only specific
source addresses (an include list) or from any source except specific source addresses (an
exclude list). MLDv2 is described in RFC 3810.<br/>

<h4>IPv6 Multicast Overview</h4>
In addition to unicast and anycast support, IPv6 also provides a mechanism to send and
receive IPv6 multicast traffic. IPv6 multicast traffic is sent to a single destination address but is
received and processed by multiple IPv6 hosts, regardless of their location on the network.
Hosts listen to a specific IPv6 multicast address and receive all packets to that address.
Multicast is more efficient than IPv6 unicast for one-to-many delivery of data. Instead of
having multiple unicast packets sent, only one packet is sent.<br/>

The additional elements of IPv6 multicast include the following:
<ul>
	<li>The set of hosts listening on a specific IPv6 multicast address is called a multicast group.</li>
	<li>Multicast group membership is dynamic, and hosts can join and leave the group at
any time.</li>
	<li>There are no limitations to the size of a multicast group.</li>
	<li>A multicast group can span IPv6 routers across multiple subnets. This configuration
requires IPv6 multicast support on IPv6 routers and the ability for hosts to register
themselves with the router. Host registration is accomplished by using MLD or MLDv2.</li>
	<li>A host can send traffic to a multicast address without being a member of the group.</li>
</ul>

These are the same elements that are used for IPv4 multicast.<br/>
IPv6 multicast addresses are defined by the address prefix FF00::/8 and can have different
scopes. For more information about IPv6 multicast addresses, see Chapter 3, “IPv6
Addressing.” In contrast, IPv4 multicast addresses use the address prefix 224.0.0.0/4.
In an IPv6 multicast-enabled network, any host can send multicast traffic to any multicast
address, and any host can receive multicast traffic from any multicast address regardless of its
location. To facilitate this capability, the hosts and routers of the network must support
multicast traffic.<br/>

<h3>MLD Packet Structure</h3>
Unlike IGMPv2, MLD uses ICMPv6 messages instead of defining a separate message
structure.<br/><br/>

	<table border="1" bgcolor="white">
	<tr>
	<td>IPv6 Header<br/>Next Header = 0<br/>(Hop-by-Hop Options)</td>
	<td>Hop-by-Hop Options Header<br/>IPv6 Router Alert Option<br/>Next Header = 58 (ICMPv6)</td>
	<td>MLD Message</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
<br/>
An MLD message packet consists of an IPv6 header, a Hop-by-Hop Options extension header,
and the MLD message. The Hop-by-Hop Options extension header contains the IPv6 Router
Alert Option described in RFC 2711. It is used to ensure that routers process MLD messages
that are sent to multicast addresses for which the router is not a group member.
<h3>MLD Messages</h3>
There are three types of MLD messages:
<ol>
<li>Multicast Listener Query (ICMPv6 Type 130)</li>
<li>Multicast Listener Report (ICMPv6 Type 131)</li>
<li>Multicast Listener Done (ICMPv6 Type 132)</li>
</ol>
All three MLD messages share the same message structure.
